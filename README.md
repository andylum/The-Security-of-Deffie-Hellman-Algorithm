## Abstract
The Diffie-Hellman protocol facilitates secure key exchange for message encryption but lacks entity authentication, rendering it susceptible to security threats like man-in-the-middle and impersonation attacks. This project explores discrete logarithm problem (DLP) resolution steps, state-of-the-art findings, SUN NFS cryptosystem assessment, and prime number size recommendations for a secure Diffie-Hellman implementation.

## Introduction
In this project for, we assume a foundational understanding of number theory and abstract algebra. Cryptosystems heavily rely on public key cryptography and key exchange protocols for safeguarding data. These systems are underpinned by one-way functions, where the seminal work of Diffie and Hellman introduced the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) as a robust source of such functions. We delve into the intricacies of DLP resolution and present state-of-the-art breakthroughs in this context. While solving DLP is feasible, the challenge lies in achieving a quick resolution, especially for sufficiently large prime numbers (p) crucial for security. The project also addresses key exchange, an early cryptographic concern, and underscores the growing importance of data security amid the pervasive internet landscape. We explore the SUN NFS cryptosystem's use of directories to manage data efficiently. Additionally, the selection of secure prime numbers for Diffie-Hellman security is a central focus of this project.

## Goals
In this project, several key goals could be pursued to enhance its scope and impact. Firstly, a primary objective could be to develop a robust implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm that not only securely exchanges keys but also integrates advanced security features to counteract known vulnerabilities like man-in-the-middle attacks. Secondly, the project could aim to streamline the user experience by creating a user-friendly interface for the algorithm, making it more accessible to a wider range of users. Furthermore, goals may involve researching and implementing state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to ensure the algorithm's resilience in contemporary cryptographic landscapes. Additionally, conducting thorough testing and validation to assess the algorithm's security, efficiency, and scalability is vital. Lastly, the project could focus on educational aspects, such as creating documentation and tutorials to facilitate understanding and implementation for both novice and advanced users. These multifaceted goals would contribute to the project's success, making it a valuable resource for the field of cryptography and key exchange.

## Results
The investigation reveals that solving the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is inherently variable due to factors like group type and prime size. While there's no universal equation for DLP, using sufficiently large primes makes practical solutions improbable in today's cryptographic landscape. State-of-the-art DLP results are characterized by extreme time requirements, reinforcing the effectiveness of DLP as a one-way function for security and encryption. Network File System (NFS) succeeded due to its robustness and adaptability, offering close-to-open consistency and cache re-validation. Ensuring secure prime numbers for Diffie-Hellman involves using a good DH modulus, generating safe primes, and balancing size for optimal security without becoming counterproductive.
